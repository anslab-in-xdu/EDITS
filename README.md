# EDITS
Differentially Private Data Publishing by Image Denoising

### Introduction

This project proposes EDITS, a novel image denosing-based post-processing framework, to transform DP-protected data into images and use image denoisers to improve the data accuracy while maintaining the privacy guarantee by DP. 

EDITS is flexible and can be applied to a variety of data types, such as time series data, histogram data and geospatial data. 

We prototyped the framework by adopting the filter- and deep learning-enabled denoisers but user can also choose any preferred denoising methods thanks to the modular design of EDITS.
